# What are negative indexing and why are they used
'''Negative Indexing is used to in Python to begin slicing from the end of the string i.e. the last. 
Slicing in Python gets a sub-string from a string. The slicing range is set as parameters i.e. start, stop and step.

# Example
myStr = 'Thisisit!'

print("String = ", myStr)

print("String after slicing (negative indexing) = ", myStr[-4:-1])
