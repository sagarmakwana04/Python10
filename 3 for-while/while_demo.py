# looping etle jya sudhi given condition fulfil na thai tya sudhi iterate thaya karvu
# Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
# And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
'''Statements represent all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are 
considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements. When a while loop is executed, 
expr is first evaluated in a Boolean context and if it is true, the loop body is executed. Then the expr is checked again, 
if it is still true then the body is executed again and this continues until the expression becomes false.'''
