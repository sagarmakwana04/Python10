# What is list :
"""In Python, a list is an important and widely used data type. Multiple values can be stored in the list (that can be heterogeneous). 
Lists are mutable (inside values can be changed) and ordered(means the elements will remain in the same order as you have 
specified during a list declaration."""


# reverse a list
l=[1,2,4,0,"Python",True,42,9732,"django",432]
print(l[::-1])
